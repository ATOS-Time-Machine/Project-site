<p>
    Authentication allows you to generate a token so that you can access the other functionalities the API has to offer. In order
    to authenticate your credentials you can make a post request to /authenticate
</p>

<pre>
    <code class="language-js">
        Curl -d <payload goes here> http://atostimemachine.westus.cloudapp.azure.com/api/authenticate
    </code>
</pre>

<p>
    Where the payload is constructed of the following fields put into JSON:
</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Id</td>
    <td>This is your normal staff id that you log into your ATOS account with.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Password</td>
    <td>This is the password which your supervisor assigned alongside your staff id when they made your account.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
    The response message from this will be constructed of the following:
</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Success</td>
    <td>This a boolean field which details wherever the post request was successful.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Token (Optional)</td>
    <td>This is a string which contains the encoded id you authenticated with, and whether or not your credentials provide you with an admin status (this is only returned if the success is true).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Admin (Optional)</td>
    <td>This a boolean field which indicated whether or not your credentials provide you with an admin status.</td>
