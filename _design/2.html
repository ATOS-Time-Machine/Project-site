<h4> Model-View-Controller </h4>
<p>
    The model view controller pattern is an architecture design pattern that divides your application into a distinct three section structure in order to provide more clarity and improve maintenance, and we have also employed this strategy with our frontend, API, and database controller.
</p>

<h4> Callback </h4>
<p>
    The use of callbacks is a design pattern which is commonly found in javascript written for networking purposes. Our application makes use of it in order to make all of our function asynchronous  which mean that the server can run all functionalities in the background with slowing the down anything that making use of the API (including our frontend).

</p>

<h4> Observer </h4>
<p>
    The observer pattern involves making use of events and listeners, which we use with our program so that the tables present on the front can be automatically updated when another user (or someone using the API) makes a change that would affect the respective tables.
</p>

<h4> E-R data modelling </h4>
<p>
    This is a design pattern that affects the structure of our database. We followed this by having our database in 3rd normalised form in order to preserve our data’s integrity and remove redundancy and future proof it from errors. 
</p>

<h4> Modular </h4>
<p>
    This is a design pattern which involved dividing up your codebase and importing it when necessary. We used this with our control file to make it more convenient to set up unit tests as they wouldn’t be using the API routes only the core functionality, and we also used it for our config file so we wouldn’t have to upload it to our public repository.
