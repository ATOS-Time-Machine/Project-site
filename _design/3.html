        <div id="browsers">

                <li>Safari</li>

                <li>Firefox</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We decided that we would try and keep our web application flexible and able to be used all of the most web browsers
                which are still being developed. This will allow our clients more flexibility in choosing the web browsers
                they want to use, especially if they change later on after development has been completed.</p>

        <div id="techs">
            <ul class="browser-default">
                <li>HTML5</li>
                <li>CSS3</li>
                <li>JavaScript</li>
                <li>PHP</li>
                <li>MYSQL</li>
                <li>NodeJS</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We choose programming languages that we were already comfortable with because our client’s gave us free reign
                on which language to use. The combination of these languages will easily allow us to program both our front-ends
                and back-ends with the addition of the fact that PHP was designed to be able to be integrated with HTML and
                Javascript.</p>

        <div id="deploy">
            <ul class="browser-default">
                <li>Cloud Server- Azure</li>
                <li>Script for automatic build for each version control push</li>
                <li>Script for automatic restart on server reboot</li>
                <li>Script for automatic database backups</li>
                <li>Script for automating unit tests for each build</li>
                <li>Script for moving staging build to production server</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We decided to use Azure as a Cloud Server as one of our team members has had previous experiences using it. We
                also compared Azure service with the Amazon EC2, and we found the first one to be easier to use and more
                suitable for this project’s goals. We chose to write scripts for automise version control push, reboots,
                backups creation and unit test as it will save us time and it will best prevent human errors.
            </p>

        <div id="editors">
            <ul class="browser-default">
                <li>Sublime Text 3</li>
                <li>Atom</li>
                <li>WebStorm</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Each of our group members will most likely be using different text editors according to what they are most useful
                which in terms of this project we felt would be most useful as using what you are comfortable with will make
                it easier to develop more efficiently. Due to the nature of using HTML, Javascript and PHP, the fact that
                we are using different text editors will not make any difference and will just provide more convenience for
                us.

        <div id="design">
            <ul class="browser-default">
                <li>Balsamiq Mockups</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In order to create our wireframes to be a high fidelity representation of our user interface designs we decided
                to use Balsamiq. This enables to quickly create high quality wireframes where we can easily demonstrate how
                we are consider design principles and gearing our interface to stand up to Nielsen Heuristics. This also
                means that our clients will be able to have a better idea of the direction we’re taking.

        <div id="version">
            <ul class="browser-default">
                <li>Git (Github)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For our version control we decided to use github since all of our team members have had previous experience with
                it before, and our clients did not mind where we host our repository. Github is a version control system
                which works with git allowing all of the contributors to push to the same repository allowing this project
                to be more of a collaborative effort. We also chose to use Github over other version control system because
                of the broad community and wide amount of support meaning anyone else who might want to on this project at
                a later date will easily be able to do so.
