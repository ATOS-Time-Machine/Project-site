        <li>
            <div class="white collapsible-header active"><b>Architecture Design</b></div>
            <div class="white collapsible-body">The architecture of our project follows the standards that have been set by many other web applications with separate backends and frontends with an API to be used by other external applications and therefore it enabled to create an application that was fit for purpose and easy to set up for our client’s use.</div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div class="white collapsible-header"><b>User interface design and user experience</b></div>
            <div class="white collapsible-body">The user interface of the front end of our application was designed to be an improved version of the time machine application. This was a success as we made it more aesthetically pleasing and we made it even more usable as we made more of the elements have increased visibility making easy to figure out what to do without having to look at a user guide</div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div class="white collapsible-header"><b>Functionality</b></div>
            <div class="white collapsible-body">Our version of time machine was able to offer all of the same functionality as the previous version of time machine (to our knowledge) as well as additional functionality as requested by our user such as the various spreadsheet generation options. These functionalities can also be accessed from outside of the application due to the fact that the backend is coupled with an API.</div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div class="white collapsible-header"><b>Stability</b></div>
            <div class="white collapsible-body">The web application has been deployed in a complete status for several weeks now and has not been taken down even when multiple ATOS employees were using it concurrently. To our knowledge there are no methods a user can employ that could cause our server to crash from using our user interface or API either.</div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div class="white collapsible-header"><b>Efficiency</b></div>
            <div class="white collapsible-body">Extensive manual testing was done on the Google Chrome web browser so we can confirm that all functionalities work on it. We additionally did some testing on Mozilla Firefox and Opera and all functionality appeared to be operational too. However we know that there will be a lot of problems on Internet Explorer as the MaterializeCSS library that we used does not support Internet Explorer itself.</div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div class="white collapsible-header"><b>Compatibility</b></div>
            <div class="white collapsible-body">The architecture of our project follows the standards that have been set by many other web applications with separate backends and frontends with an API to be used by other external applications and therefore it enabled to create an application that was fit for purpose and easy to set up for our client’s use.</div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div class="white collapsible-header"><b>Maintainability</b></div>
            <div class="white collapsible-body">The method used to deploy our web application sets up all packages that are required and sets up the backend as its own service so that it is easy to restart if necessary (such as deployment). Deployment is also done automatically when a commit is pushed to the production branch so that nothing on the server needs to be changed with the exception of updating packages if necessary for any new features.</div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div class="white collapsible-header"><b>Evaluation of Testing</b></div>
            <div class="white collapsible-body">For our application we made use of unit tests which are applied to the backend test to make sure that all of the functions still work as intended by creating an artificial connection to the database. This does mean that we don’t test for any faults with the database and the connection to it, but we do have the tests being automated when a commit is pushed to the testing branch.</div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div class="white collapsible-header"><b>Project management</b></div>
            <div class="white collapsible-body">We feel as though the project has fairly well managed throughout the whole process. All of the members have consistently had tasks to do, and after they had finished they were quick to be provided with their next task. However the time taken for each task was underestimated quite a bit which resulted in some additional unnecessary pressure.</div>
