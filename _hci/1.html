title: Initial UI Design
---
<p class="section">
        Before working on the user interface we found it important that we have a design in mind, as it can take a lot
        of time to change in an coded prototype. We straight away went into developing a higher fidelity user interface
        prototype utilizing the Balsamiq wireframe software and skip making sketches as we could already partially base
        the design on what we saw in the user guide. We also made sure the designs that we were making were good
        examples of computer science and software engineering by making sure they were conforming to our requirements
        and the general HCI design principles.
