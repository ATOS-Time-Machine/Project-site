title: Design principles
---
<p class="section">During the process of designing the user interface we made sure to consider the following
            design principles
            in order to ensure the work we were producing would be both good computer science and also of the high
            quality that our clients are looking for. The following details how we considered these design principles
            (visibility, affordance, feedback, consistency and constraints).</p>

        <h5>Visibility</h5>
        <p>We ensured that we considered visibility when designing our user interface prototype, by ensuring that none
            of the functionalities were hidden. All of the button, text inputs, and other inputs were made large enough
            such that everything can be found without it being obtrusive to the other elements on the page. We also made
            use of several tabs throughout the design most notably the static tabs resident at the top of every page
            once logged which makes it really visible where the different sections and functionalities are. We also made
            it so that’s possible to get every page from every page page with a minimal amount of clicks ensuring users
            can not get to page they shouldn’t.</p>

        <br>

        <h5>Affordance</h5>
        <p>We ensured that we considered affordance when designing our user interface prototype, by ensuring that all
            elements on the web application avoided being ambiguous, such as making sure the buttons actually looked
            like something which could be pressed down. We also made it so every input on the page clearly states what
            it is in order to make it intuitive about what to put into those inputs, or when to use them. We also went
            with a minimalist approach to the design which means we only have what we need on the page as to obfuscate
            details on the page making it somewhat more difficult to use and navigate.</p>

        <br>

        <h5>Feedback</h5>
        <p>We ensured that we considered feedback when designing our user interface prototype, by ensuring that the user
            always knows the intended result of the input element that the are accessing and that after an action on the
            system has being completed it is clearly communicated to the user that what they wanted to do has or hasn’t
            been a success. In order to achieve this every button, text field, and other inputs will have tooltips which
            activate upon hovering over these elements informing the user of what the intended use of it is. We also
            plan to have dialog boxes on all non-reversible inputs like submitting an overtime request to give to user a
            chance to back out if they made a mistake.</p>

        <br>

        <h5>Consistency</h5>
        <p>We ensured that we considered consistency when designing our user interface prototype, by ensuring that there
            is a consistent theme across all of the web pages in our web application. This can be seen from the ATOS
            logo (which functions as a home button) and common set of static tabs found out the top of every page except
            the login page. The way in which forms are presented has also been made consistent across all relevant
            screens to allow users the opportunity to get used to the style eventually increasing the rate of which they
            can used these forms. We have even made the login page consistent with the recover password page in the
            sense that the ATOS logo remains in the same location in both screens and the input elements remain in the
            same “column” on both pages.</p>

        <br>

        <h5>Constraints</h5>
        <p>We ensured that we considered constraints when designing our user interface prototype, by ensuring that is
            impossible for our users to navigate to a page they should not be able to access so the only error they get
            is when they have a client side issue like a lack of internet connection. We are also planning to have
            varying permission levels of the site depending on the role associated with the user’s profile, that limits
            which of the systems functionalities can be accessed. We will implement this by removing the associated
            screens with these functionalities from the static tabs situated at the top of the page and redirecting them
            to the home page if they manually try to access it.</p>
