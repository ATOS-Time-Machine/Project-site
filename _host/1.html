<p>
    For this application, we make use of NodeJS and MySQL to power our backend API and database respectively. For our frontend which is used to demonstrate 
    the capabilities of our API, we have employed Apache2 HTTP Server. These tools are available on a variety of operating systems and as a result, 
    this setup can be hosted on a variety of machines.
</p>

<h4>Our Server</h4>
<p>
    For our demonstration purposes, we hosted on Ubuntu Server 16.04, making use of Microsoft Azure's virtual machine service. As part of 
    this setup, HTTP traffic on port 80 needs to be allowed. This can be done on the configuration page of the Azure portal or any 
    hosting service you make use of.
</p>

<ul class="browser-default">
