title: Create An Application Service
tag: service
---
<p>
    Thanks to Apache, our frontend will respond to HTTP requests when someone accesses the website. However,
    the backend is run using NodeJS and is required to be started otherwise our frontend application will be
    unable to communicate with the database.
</p>
<p>
    To get around this, we setup a service on the server which starts the NodeJS backend whenever it crashes or
    the server restarts. Additionally, it will give us an easy way of manually starting/stopping the application
    ourselves should we need to debug or automate (this will come up later).
</p>

<p>First we create the service file</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">

</code></pre>

Then we enable the service:
<pre><code class="language-bash">
sudo systemctl enable timemachiine.service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart timemachine.service
</code></pre>

Provided all is working, we will now be able to manage the service using the commands
<pre><code class="language-bash">
# Check service status
service timemachine status

# Start service
sudo service timemachine start

# Stop service
sudo service timemachine stop

# Restart service
sudo service timemachine restart
</code></pre>
