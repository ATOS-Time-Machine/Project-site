        <h4>Introduction</h4>
        <p>
            After getting our project synopsis, we set about brainstorming some ideas on what we wanted to make and what
            our focus should be. Some ideas involved a full-stack application with a backend API with ideas being
            discussed on whether the focus should be the frontend design or the API so applications can be build upon it
            easily later by other teams. There were additional talks on mobile access and whether a mobile app should be
            made - or just focus on a mobile app altogether - or whether to make a web app that’s compatible with mobile
            devices. As a result, it became evident that the research into the various frameworks could be taken
            advantage of to assist our development process was necessary.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card row">
        <ul class="tabs tabs-fixed-width">
            <li class="tab"><a class="active" href="#mobile">Mobile</a></li>
            <li class="tab"><a href="#desktop">Desktop</a></li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div id="mobile">
        <h5>Background</h5>
        <p>
            One of the options being considered was a mobile app. This was because the client was happy for us to focus
            on
            ideas and creating something unique and different from what they currently had. Whether alone or in tandem
            with
            a web app for computer access, we decided that the optimal thing to do would be to make apps for both iOS
            and
            Android since this would be the most convenient solution for the client as their staff make use of both
            platforms. This left us with a couple of options, either we make native apps for both Android and iOS using
            the
            native, first-class frameworks for both platforms (native apps), or we make use of a cross-platform
            framework
            that would allow us to build apps for both platforms simultaneously (hybrid apps).
        </p>
        <br>
        <h5>Native</h5>
        <p>
            Native apps have several advantages over hybrid apps which all centre around usability. Native apps have
            better
            performance which can extend from the launch time of the app, its stability, to the smoothness of the
            animations
            and transitions within it, better, more reliable framework access to hardware functionality from the device
            -
            think GPS, camera, gyro etc. - and better support and documentation to rely upon. These are important
            aspects to
            consider as they play a vital role in improving the user experience. Despite these advantages, taking this
            approach would require knowledge of both Android and Swift/Objective-C and the platform frameworks necessary
            for
            development. On our team, only one member has experience with Android development which would require Swift
            and
            iOS to be learned from the beginning. This requirement is an important point to consider when decided what
            direction to take.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h5>Hybrid</h5>
        <p>
            On the other hand, hybrid apps have gained a lot of ground in terms of access to hardware functionality and
            documentation and ultimately have a big pay off in allowing development of multiple apps almost
            simultaneously by allowing a shared codebase to be developed and then added to for platform specific
            details. This will save a great deal in development time. Two of the most popular cross-platform frameworks
            are Ionic and Xamarin. Each has their own strength and weakness.
        </p>
        <p class="padding">
            Ionic is a cross-platform framework that is based on AngularJS. Angular is an extremely popular framework
            that has a ton of resources to draw upon to assist in its implementation. As it’s based on Angular, it makes
            use of web development skills such as HTML, CSS and Javascript. This is an advantageous framework for the
            team as everyone on it has experience with web dev to an extent. Xamarin on the other hand is a Microsoft
            framework that makes use of (primarily) C# for development but other languages can be made use of quite
            easily. Performance of Xamarin is also superior so would allow us to provide the closest experience to
            native apps possible while not actually developing natively. The flexibility of languages choice is also
            quite beneficial as it would allow us to make use of (for example) Python.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h5>Web</h5>
        <p>
            Compared to a native mobile app, there are no inherent benefits to a web app, especially when considering
            the availability of hybrid apps as they take away the benefit of being to develop something usable for both
            platforms at once while adding their own benefit of better performance and having the possibility for a more
            intuitive interface. The real benefit of developing a web app comes from making it a mobile version of a
            desktop web app as it would allow for an overlap in codebase with the desktop version allowing for the focus
            to lie with the desktop UI.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="desktop">
        <h5>Background</h5>
        <p>
            For creating a full stack implementation, there are multiple frameworks that can be made use of for
            development. We decided on a web based solution as it would allow us to develop for multiple platforms
            (since a compatible browser would be the only requirement) including mobile. This would also follow on from
            the current overtime management system allowing for consistency in workflow. Additionally, there are
            numerous methods of creating web content now while using different languages which gives us the flexibility
            to pick our preferred platform. Examples of possible frameworks and their corresponding “first class”
            languages (as in some cases, alternative languages are possible) include NodeJS which makes extensive use of
            JavaScript, Django and Python and .Net Core with C#.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h5>NodeJS</h5>
        <p>
            NodeJS is a development platform that gives access to many frameworks. It is extremely fleshed out with a
            lot of resources to draw upon and it performs very efficiently and by its very nature is designed for web
            applications but additionally allows for a lot of processing to be done server-side with will contribute to
            a smoother experience for the end user. Many of us on the team have experience with web development too so.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h5>Django</h5>
        <p>
            Django is an alternative full-stack framework that would allow us to build our site using Python. Python is
            a very modern language that many of us in the group are familiar with and is very “easy” to write code for -
            by which I mean a lot can be achieved with relatively little and simple code. Django itself is designed to
            make the whole web development process easy and quick.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h5>.Net Core</h5>
        <p>
            .Net Core is a newer framework build (primarily) off C# developed by Microsoft that would allow the
            manufacture and development of web apps with relative ease, handling a lot of the client-server interactions
            for you making things a lot simpler. Additionally, as Xamarin and .Net Core get closer together, it will
            make converting the apps into mobile apps through Xamarin easier which has additional benefits.
        </p>
