        In order to make sure that our project adheres to the requirements elicited from our client, we will be putting
        a great deal of focus on testing ensuring that it upheld throughout the development process. The following
        details on this page explore the testing strategies that we will be employing.

    <h4>Unit Testing</h4>
    <p>
        Our client wanted a method to make sure that if any changes are made to the backend API they could ensure that their functionality will be preserved if any changes are made. Our unit tests are written using a framework called mocha and they operate by creating an artificial connection to the database. This does mean that we don’t test for any faults with the database and the connection to it, but we do have the tests being automated when a commit is pushed to the testing branch. The tests were automated using travis CI and writing a script that automatically installs all the necessary packages and then runs all of the unit tests showing the result of this in the git commit log.

    <h4>User Acceptance Testing</h4>
    <p>
        Client review: We feel the team met the initial requirements outlined for the Time Machine. The team had to work with the constraint the more specific details around the special claims form format requirements weren’t provided and that we were unable to provide the team access to ESS, which is essential to be able to develop a tool guaranteed to integrate with it. Having completed some pilot testing, we found the tool extremely easy to use. The request form layout was clear and logical and completion of the form could be done quickly. The Login screen looked nice and funky. It was easy to add users and the different roles were defined. The processing of an OT request and approval was tested successfully. We liked the link to user guidelines being available from each page (albeit they are still in development J).
